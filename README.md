# project-euler-haskell

My most recent method of procrastination is solving Project Euler problems in Haskell.  Whatever solutions are here are correct, although I can't promise that they are Haskellic (or whatever the right word is for idiomatic Haskell).  I also can't promise that they are efficient, although they all produce their answers in a reasonable amount of time on my not-super-powered laptop.
